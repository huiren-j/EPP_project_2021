# Replication of R. Dizon-Ross (2014)  <a class = "tocSkip">
---

**This repository** contains my replication of the results from the following paper:

> Dizon-Ross, Rebecca. 2019. "Parents' Beliefs about Their Children's Academic Ability: Implications for Educational Investments." American Economic Review, 109 (8): 2728-65.  
    

The structure of this repository is made by a template offered by --add. Thus the required environment is basically included in this template and can be generated by environment.yml.
    
**This replication** consists of files to produce 4 tables and 4 figures. In order to see the tables directly, simply run `"table_produce.py"` in "../src/final". It contains functions defined at `"tables_management.py"` and `"tables_analysis.py"`. Each files include codes to prepare for analysis and to run the regressions. For the case of figures, they would be also produced by running `"figures_produce.py"`. Likewise, the detailed functions for generating figures are in `"figures_management.py"` and `"figures_analysis.py"`. All data for the analysis are in "src/original_data". In addition, I appended a short extenstion to show relation between education and parents' financial status with evidence of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. This part will visualize land price and the number of private institute related to university entrance exams by district level. In order to see this result, use `"extension.py"`.

# 1. Introduction
---
    
<br>
Dizon-Ross(2019) examined parents' beliefs about their children's academic ability. Since Parents are the decision maker for their children's education investment, it is important for parents to have good standard for the investment. The author argues that educational investment decision depends on the parents' beliefs about their children's academic ability. This kind of belief is generally formed by school report cards which is available for all for free. However, the author points out that this is not the case. Parents can be a factor to make differences in availability of the information about their children's academic performance. For example, if the parents have low level of education than their children's currently do, then it would be difficult for the parents to evaluate their children's school performance accurately. That is, parents could have inaccurate belief about their children's school performance due to lack of information and it lead the parents to make wrong investment decision on education.
    


<br>
The main hypothesis is that parents' investment decisions rely on their beliefs. Figure 1. shows that the relation between beliefs and investments based on the hypothesis. PanelA implies that parents have prospensity to underestimate their children's ability if children's achievements are high, and to overestimate if children's achievements are low. Therefore, the author argues that if current investment is depending on their accurate beleifs, then correcting their beliefs by delievering accurate information will attenuate the slope on beliefs.

# 2. Empirical Approach for Detecting Mistakes
---

Parents' investment on education implies both the *level* of spending and the specific *type* of educatinal resources for each child.
The peceived production function for child j's quality is

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;q_{ij}&space;=&space;f(s_{ij},&space;a_{ij})" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} q_{ij} = f(s_{ij}, a_{ij})" />

where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;s_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} s_{ij}" /> = parent i's investment choice for child j,<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;a_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} a_{ij}" /> = child j's baseline academic performance, and function f is concave in <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;s_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} s_{ij}" />.


In addtion, we assume that parent i's investment choice <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;s_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} s_{ij}" /> is to maximize household utility:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;s^*_{ij}&space;=&space;\underset{s}{\operatorname{argmax}}U(q_{ij})" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} s^*_{ij} = \underset{s}{\operatorname{argmax}}U(q_{ij})" />

Lastly, assume parent i does not know child j's true performance. That is the parents formulate their own belief $\alpha_{ij}$ described by distribution <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;g(\alpha_{ij},&space;\sigma^2_{ij})" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} g(\alpha_{ij}, \sigma^2_{ij})" />
where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;&space;\alpha_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} \alpha_{ij}" /> means parent i's *belief* about child j's academic ability and <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110}&space;\sigma^2_{ij}" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{110} \sigma^2_{ij}" /> means parents' belief uncertainty.

# 3. Experimental Design and Outcomes(Data)
---

### 3.1. Experimental Design
<br>

- <u>Sample selection</u>
:The study worked with 39 schools in two districts in Malawi. Schools were selected randomly form the universe of primary schools. The experiment subject is student in grades 2 to 6. Also, this experiment is conducted by selecting siblings in this target grade. If there are more than 2 sibilings from one household, then two of them were chosen randomly.
    
    
- <u>Randomization</u>
    : The treatment is infromation intervention. That is one half of the chosen households will be delievered an accurate information about their children's school performance. This treated group was selected randomly. The randomization is based on a test score measure and a proxy for parent education.
    
- <u>Eligibility Inverviews</u>
    : These above process were conducted based on data gathered from students at school and on school administrative data. Among 3,451 sampled households, 21 percent of households were found to be ineligible during the parent intervies. Thus, final experimental sample comprises 5,268 parent-child pairs.
