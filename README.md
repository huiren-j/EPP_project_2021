# 1. Introduction

Dizon-Ross(2019) examined parents' beliefs about their children's academic ability. Since Parents are the decision maker for their children's education investment, it is important for parents to have good standard for the investment. The author argues that educational investment decision depends on the parents' beliefs about their children's academic ability. This kind of belief is generally formed by school report cards which is available for all for free. However, the author points out that this is not the case. Parents can be a factor to make differences in availability of the information about their children's academic performance. For example, if the parents have low level of education than their children's currently do, then it would be difficult for the parents to evaluate their children's school performance accurately. That is, parents could have inaccurate belief about their children's school performance due to lack of information and it lead the parents to make wrong investment decision on education.
